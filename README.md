# Disaster-Message-Pipeline
The libaries that are used in the project are pandas, sklearn, pickle, sqlalchemy and nltk (natural language toolkit).

Pandas' main object is the dataframe. It is compatible with numpy, a popular data analysis tool. Pandas is a versatile library that allows you to read data from various file types, write to different file types, and even upload and pull data from databases. The dataframe are essentially tables that allow easy manipulated and allows for different types to be used, unlike in numpy which doesn't particular like different types in its arrays.

Sklearn (Scikit-Learn) is a machine learning library. It contains an incredible number of different objects and tools to be used. This library has machine learning models such as neural networks, linear models, random forests, and SVM to name a few.

Sqlalchemy is a database interaction libary. This library allows users to make connections to various different sql databases and pull or push data. This libary can be used alongside Pandas to upload data or pull data using SQL. 

Nltk is a natural language processing library. It enables users to parse through large amount of text data and simpifiy text.

The file used in this analysis are messages compiles by figure eight. There are 36 different categories that the message can fall into. 

The motivation of this analysis is that I am apart of a Udacity course that requires an analysis of dataset that can have business relevance.

Achknowledgements: Udacity and Figure Eight.
